The original usage of this script was to take images that were uploaded on posterwhore.com that were originally somewhere in the 30k - 90k range, and get them an optimal size, since the site loaded multiple images per page. Additionally, I wanted to use the Rackspace Cloud Files solution to act as a CDN. 

This comes packaged with the PHP API code from the Rackspace website. It contains all the code you need to get the images onto the Cloud Files CDN.

HOW TO USE
1) Get a Rackspace Cloud Files account & API key ( http://www.rackspacecloud.com ) ( Your Account -> API Access )
2) Make a container in your Cloud Files account ( Hosting -> Cloud Files -> +Add Container )
2) Upload the /optimize directory to your server
3) Set your options in the $arrConfig array inside optimize.php
4) Ensure your images and optimized dirs have proper permissions for your server
5) Make modifications to the queries if you're querying for images ( see ~lines 137,157 )

IMPORTANT
It should be noted that this script was used in conjunction with a database of images. I used a flag for each image record, that denoted if the image had been placed on the CDN yet. The filename on the CDN is whatever you want it to be. I just used this flag to tell which hostname to serve the image from in my front-end markup.
